# Clojure

## Cookbook (small code pieces for common tasks)

- Convert binary to decimal (Long/parseLong "001110" 2)
- Pivot a table/list of lists `(defn pivot [xs] (apply map vector xs))`
- component local state goes inside defn, the returned body needs to be encased
  in an anonymouse fn `(fn [] [:div ...])`

## Fireplace

Shift K - look up the definition for the function under the cursor
Require! - requires the namespace with :reload-all to also reload dependencies
cpr - Require|RunTests
c!! - eval/replace the current sexp with it's result

## Reference / Weirdness Explained

- #(%) Anonymous Functions in a threaded macro
  anonymous functions are generated by a reader macro before normal macro
  expansion, which is normally fine but it is already a list. This leads the
  thread macro into believing the function can already been applied. Adding
  extra parens fixes this by applying the anonymous function to no args.
