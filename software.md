# Software

## Philosophy

- Static type checks aren't actually that useful for solving the big problems
  in programming [1]
- Java is good at mechanical problems, but bad at [rich hickey situated programs, common web apps]
- Type systems, couple the systems together and make changes much more difficult.
- semantic positioning is hard to read (e.g parameters) pass in a map with keys?

## Clojure

- There are in-built aliases, for example: clojure -Spom will generate a
  pom.xml for your project.
